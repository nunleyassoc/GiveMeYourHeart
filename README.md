A Git for the UWF 2023 GameJam - Give Me Your Heart

[To play the game, download it from this google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TRK1MbELkxUae02nvh36L3Zy1Ku5uH-e/view?usp=drive_link) (godot games are not really supported on github I think)

This game works best in 1920 x 1080 monitor resolution.
There is an extremly high chance of visual issues if played in other resolutions.

This is my first game ever and I'm very thankful for this opportunity to represent UWF!
